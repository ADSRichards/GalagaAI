# Self-Learning Galaga

1. Get FCEUX and a Galaga ROM.
2. Run FCEUX and go to file -> new Lua script window and run the script.

The script learns galaga through random updates. The inputs that produce the greatest score are saved and random deviations are accepted if they result in a greater score.
